Title: RMAWGEN (R Multi-site Auto-regressive Weather GENerator), a package to
    generate daily time series of precipitation and temperature from monthly
    mean values
Type: Package
Author: Emanuele Cordano, Emanuele Eccel
Description: This package contains S3 and S4 functions for spatial multi-site
    stochastic generation of daily time series of temperature and
    precipitation. The implemented tools make use of Vector AutoRegressive
    models (VARs). The VAR is calibrated by daily instrumental "Gaussianized"
    time series and then works with monthly time series as input. Example
    script files about its usage are available on "RMAWGENCodeCorner" GitHub
    project (see link below). Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration of any kind
    are warmly welcome.
